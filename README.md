# Finance projects

Here I present my finance projects (until now!):
1) Simple Blackâ€“Scholes model through brownian motion to simulate financial assets.
2) Visualization of popular stocks like MSFT, AAPL etc.
3) Portfolio optimization for a weighted average for a couple of stocks taking into account variance and return.
4) Portofolio optimization (data driven, partially taken by an excellent youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/@quantprogram)
