# Finance projects

Here I present my finance projects (until now!):
1) Simple Blackâ€“Scholes model through brownian motion to simulate financial assets.
2) Visualization of popular stocks like MSFT, AAPL etc. (datavisual file)
3) Interactive Visualization of stocks using streamlit (datavisual file)
4) Portfolio optimization for a weighted average for a couple of stocks taking into account variance.
5) Portofolio optimization (data driven, partially taken by an excellent youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/@quantprogram)
6) Momentum and moving average trading simulation using backtrader.
