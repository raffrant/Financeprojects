Quantitative Finance Projects

Below is a portfolio of applied quantitative finance projects that demonstrate expertise in mathematical modeling, data analysis, and algorithmic trading. Source code and visualizations are available in linked files; all projects leverage Python and industry-standard libraries.

1) Option Pricing Models:
   Developed and simulated asset paths using Brownian motion for Blackâ€“Scholes option pricing.

2) Stock Data Analytics and Visualization:
   Designed static and interactive dashboards (via Streamlit) for visual exploration of major stocks (e.g., MSFT, AAPL), highlighting trends, and time-series dynamics. (datavisual file)

4) Portfolio Optimization:
   Programmed multi-asset portfolio optimization routines utilizing mean-variance analysis. Implemented both classical weighted approaches and data-driven, real-market inspired algorithms based     on reputable quant research channels (https://www.youtube.com/@quantprogram).

5) Algorithmic Trading Strategies:
   Backtested systematic momentum and moving average trading systems using Backtrader, evaluating Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and execution performance under transaction costs.

6) Machine Learning in Trading:
   Applied supervised learning techniques to predict entry/exit points for assets such as MSFT. The framework includes automated feature engineering and             validation on out-of-sample data.
   
Ongoing and Upcoming:
Currently extending machine learning approaches for regime detection and automated market making. Additional projects in high-frequency data modeling and alternative data integration are in progress.
